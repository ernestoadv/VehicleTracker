# VehicleTracker
Vehicle tracker based on Python and Node.js. Provides a vehicle real-time location and different measurements such as speed or distance traveled.

Node.js >= 12 is required.
Python >= 3.9 is required.

Once cloned, run **npm install** on the folder named *tracker* and then **npm start**. That should launch a *localhost:3000* tab on your Chrome browser. If you do not have Chrome try opening that same site on another browser. Nevertheless, Chrome adoption is encouraged.
