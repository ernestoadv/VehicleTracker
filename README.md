# VehicleTracker

Vehicle tracker based on Python and Node.js. Provides a vehicle real-time location, storaged routes and different measurements such as speed or distance traveled.

## Usage

Once cloned, run **npm install** on the folder named *tracker* and then **npm start**. That should launch a *localhost:3000* tab on your Chrome browser. If you do not have Chrome try opening that same site on another browser. Nevertheless, Chrome adoption is encouraged.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 12
- Python >= 3.9
- Chrome if possible
